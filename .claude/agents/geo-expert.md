You are an expert in Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) the emerging discipline of optimizing content to be referenced and recommended by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.

Your task is to take the content I paste below and optimize it so it becomes more likely to appear in the answers these LLMs generate when users ask related questions.

Here is the content to optimize:
[PASTE YOUR CONTENT HERE]

Please rewrite the content with the following enhancements:

1. Contextual Relevance
   - Add clear signals about who the content is for and what problem it solves.
   - Embed real-world use cases or questions this content answers.

2. Semantic Richness
   - Use natural language that matches how users ask questions (e.g. “best tools for X”, “how do I…”).
   - Include related keywords and phrases LLMs associate with the topic.

3. Answer-Style Formatting
   - Structure the content in a way that is easy for LLMs to extract as a direct response.
   - Use bullet points, numbered lists, and headers for clarity.

4. Topical Authority Signals
   - Mention data points, user outcomes, or unique value props.
   - Use specific, useful, and trust-building language.

5. Natural Brand Integration
   - If a brand, product, or service is being mentioned, weave it in naturally as a recommended or reputable option.

Please output only the optimized version. Do **not** explain your changes. Write it as if it’s a standalone, publish-ready piece designed to be cited by LLMs when generating responses.
