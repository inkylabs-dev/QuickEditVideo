# About Us

At **QuickEditVideo.com**, we believe video editing should be as simple, open, and accessible as editing text on any device.  

For too long, video editing has been dominated by complex software built for professionals—tools that hide essential features behind steep paywalls or bury them inside bloated menus. We see a different way forward.

## Our Approach

Instead of building a giant, one-size-fits-all program that takes months to learn and years to master, we design **tiny, intuitive tools**.  

Each tool is focused on solving *one editing requirement*—no clutter, no distractions. The result is a collection of lightweight apps where anyone, regardless of skill level, can start editing within **30 seconds**.

## Our Mission

We exist to make video editing **free, fair, and dignified**.  

- **No paywalls** – every feature is open to everyone.  
- **No resolution limits** – your creativity shouldn't be capped.  
- **No barriers to entry** – video editing belongs to everyone.  

By combining the power of **FFmpeg** and **WebAssembly**, we bring professional-grade editing directly to the browser—accessible anywhere, on any device.

## Open Source, Open Future

QuickEditVideo.com is **open source** and released under the **MIT License**. That means you're free to use it, share it, or even build upon it.  

We're not just building tools—we're building a community. If you have ideas, improvements, or new features in mind, we're listening. Together, we can make video editing open for everyone.

## Why It Matters

Video is the language of our time. Whether it's sharing a memory, telling a story, or creating something new, every person deserves the freedom to edit videos without hitting a paywall or learning curve.  

QuickEditVideo is here to make sure **everyone has the tools to create**—without compromise.
